In my second year of Computer Science, I took a course on comparative programming languages. That course taught me numerous different imperative and functional programming languages. The assignment for that course was to create a poker simulator such that when you enter two hands, it tells you the winner after comparing the two. Our job was to implement this Poker simulator in 2-3 different programming languages taught during the course. Here, I have uploaded 3 different languages in which I attempted this assignment: SmallTalk, Haskell and Rust. 
My favourtire between the 3 would have to be Haskell without a doubt due to its effective lazy evaluation and its heavy emphasis on recursion.
Although I did not obtain full marks for all assignments, they were fairly fun to code.
